Exa Protocol:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
This is a smart contract written in Solidity for an ERC20 token named "Exa Protocol". Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It inherits from an ERC20 contract which is a common standard for tokens in Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 is a standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain which provides basic functionality for tokens like transfer, approve, etc. 

2. The constructor function initializes the ERC20 token with a name "Exa Protocol" and a symbol "XAP". It also mints 1 billion tokens (10^8) to the contract deployer (who is the address which deploys the contract). The total supply of tokens is set to 1 billion.

3. The function decimals() is overridden to return 8 which represents the number of decimal places used to display token amounts. In this case, every token is divided into 10^8 smallest parts (or subunits).

4. The function burn(uint256 amount) allows a user to burn or destroy a specific amount of tokens from their balance. This is done by calling _burn() function from ERC20 contract which decreases the balance of the specified address by the specified amount and decreases the total supply of tokens by the same amount. 

In summary, this contract provides a basic functionality for an ERC20 token with a specific minting rule at contract deployment. It allows for burning of tokens but does not have any other specific features or logic in it. Other functionality may be added by extending this contract or by including additional contracts or libraries in its inheritance hierarchy.

Vesting contrct:
This is a Solidity contract for a token vesting scheme.
1. It starts by declaring an ERC20 Token interface. This is so it can interact with ERC20 tokens (the most common type of token in Ethereum). It includes two functions for transferring tokens (`transfer` and `transferFrom`), which allow you to move tokens between accounts, and a function to check how many tokens an account has (`balanceOf`).

2. It defines a Vesting contract with several mappings for storing data about each wallet (address), including how much token is locked (`lockingWallet`), how long it takes to unlock (`vestingTime`), when it starts unlocking (`cliffperiod`), how much token is ready to use (`readytoUseAmt`), when it starts withdrawing (`unlockDate`), and an array of withdrawal details (`withdrawdetails`).

3. The contract also includes an event for logging token withdrawals (`withdraw`).

4. The constructor function (`constructor`) sets up some immutable variables (`tokenContract`, `onemonth`, `maxWalletLimit`, `maxVestingTime`) based on inputs provided when deploying the contract, and initializes some state variables (`lockingWallet`, `vestingTime`, etc.). 

5. The `createVesting` function is used to set up a new vesting schedule for one or more wallets (`_wallet`). It takes in arrays of token amounts (`_tokenamount`), vesting times in months (`_vestingTime`), cliff periods in months (`_cliffperiod`), and percentages of tokens ready to use (`_readytoUsePercentage`). 

6. The `CompletedVestingMonth` function returns how many months of a user's vesting period have already passed. 

7. The `withdrawableAmount` function returns how much token a user can withdraw based on their vesting schedule. 

8. The `withdrawTokens` function allows a user to withdraw their tokens based on a vesting schedule. It also logs each withdrawal event to keep track of when each withdrawal occurred. 

This contract is intended to be used with an ERC20 token on Ethereum. The vesting schedule is specified in months for simplicity, but it could be adapted to other units of time if necessary. The contract uses the ERC20 token's transfer function to move tokens between accounts.
